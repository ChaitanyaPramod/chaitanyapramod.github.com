excerpt: Notes on books Viral Loop and The Lean Startup
---
Disruption of internet service can make you do things you wouldn’t have imagined doing anytime soon. For me this weekend, it was reading books that have long been collecting dust on my desk. I read Viral Loop on Saturday and The Lean Startup on Sunday. These bullet points are just a way for me to recall what I learned from these books.

*********************

## [Viral Loop](http://www.amazon.com/Viral-Loop-Facebook-Businesses-Themselves/dp/1401323499) (Adam Penenberg)

* Viral expansion loop
  * Viral loop
  * Viral network
  * Double viral loop
* Collective curation
* Viral businesses
  * Tupperware and [Ponzi-scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponzi_scheme) (Pyramid schemes), Netscape
  * Spreadable product
  * Virality Coefficient
* Characteristics of Viral loop businesses
  * Web-based
  * Free
  * Organizational technology
  * Simple concept
  * Built-in Virality
  * Extreme fast adoption (Hotmail, Facebook, Skype)
  * Virality Index (> 1.0)
  * Predictable growth rates
  * Network effects (Telephone, IMs, social networks)
  * Stackability (on another viral business)
  * Point of nondisplacement
  * Ultimate saturation
* Viral Marketing
  * Hotmail (remember *Get your free email at Hotmail* in email footer?)
* Viral Networks
  * eBay
  * PayPal stacked over eBay
  * MySpace
  * Flickr and YouTube stacked over MySpace
* Scaling issues of (almost) every viral product
  * eBay, Twitter

In the end, it just felt like reading stories of a couple of internet successes, but was an interesting read nevertheless.

You can find lots of common references between these two books. Overall, it has been an entertaining and meaningful journey. I recommend these books to anyone building a product s/he’s is expecting to take over the world. Now that these two books are off my [to-read list](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/6917881?shelf=to-read), wondering what to read next… [Toyota Production System](http://www.amazon.com/Toyota-Production-System-Beyond-Large-Scale/dp/0915299143) by Taiichi Ohno?
